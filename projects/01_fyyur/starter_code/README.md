## Tech Stack (Dependencies)

### 1. Backend Dependencies
Our tech stack will include the following:
 * **virtualenv** as a tool to create isolated Python environments
 * **SQLAlchemy ORM** to be our ORM library of choice
 * **PostgreSQL** as our database of choice
 * **Python3** and **Flask** as our server language and server framework
 * **Flask-Migrate** for creating and running schema migrations
You can download and install the dependencies mentioned above using `pip` as:
```
pip install virtualenv
pip install SQLAlchemy
pip install postgres
pip install Flask
pip install Flask-Migrate
```
> **Note** - If we do not mention the specific version of a package, then the default latest stable package will be installed. 

### 2. Frontend Dependencies
You must have the **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Javascript** with [Bootstrap 3](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.4/customize/) for our website's frontend. Bootstrap can only be installed by Node Package Manager (NPM). Therefore, if not already, download and install the [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). Windows users must run the executable as an Administrator, and restart the computer after installation. After successfully installing the Node, verify the installation as shown below.
```
node -v
npm -v
```
Install [Bootstrap 3](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/getting-started/) for the website's frontend:
```
npm init -y
npm install bootstrap@3
```

Overall:
* Models are located in the `models.py`.
* Controllers are located in `app.py`.
* The web frontend is located in `templates/`, which builds static assets deployed to the web server at `static/`.
* Web forms for creating data are located in `form.py`


## Development Setup
1. **Download the project starter code locally**
```
git clone https://github.com/udacity/FSND.git
cd FSND/projects/01_fyyur/starter_code 
```


2. **Initialize and activate a virtualenv using:**
```
python -m virtualenv env
source env/bin/activate
```
>**Note** - In Windows, the `env` does not have a `bin` directory. Therefore, you'd use the analogous command shown below:
```
source env/Scripts/activate
```

3. **Install the dependencies:**
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. **Run the development server:**
```
export FLASK_APP=myapp
export FLASK_ENV=development # enables debug mode
python3 app.py
```

5. **Verify on the Browser**<br>
Navigate to project homepage [http://127.0.0.1:5000/](http://127.0.0.1:5000/) or [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)
