## About the Stack

We started the full stack application for you. It is designed with some key functional areas:

### Backend

The `./backend` directory contains a partially completed Flask and SQLAlchemy server.  in __init__.py we define the endpoints and we reference models.py for DB and SQLAlchemy setup.

### Frontend

The `./frontend` directory contains a complete React frontend to consume the data from the Flask server.

Pay special attention to what data the frontend is expecting from each API response to help guide how you format your API.
